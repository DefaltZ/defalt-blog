If you have developed a distate for the UI or the lack thereof of some fancy react
components that would marginally increase the eye candy allure of this blog instead of just plainly and effectively communicating a written experience I would love to get out to the world, then please keep that shit to yourself. I do not do UI/UX and neither do I really aspire to ever learn it. If i am ever in a situation where I am coerced to learn color theory, design principles or any intricacy related to UI design for any project I undertake, even in a professional setting, I would simply quit. Thank you <3
