If you have developed a distate for the UI or the lack thereof of some fancy react components that would marginally increase the eye candy allure of this blog instead of just plainly and effectively communicating a written experience I would love to get out to the world, then please keep that shit to yourself. I do not do UI/UX and neither do I really aspire to ever learn it. If i am ever in a situation where I am coerced to learn color theory, design principles or any intricacy related to UI design for any project I undertake, even in a professional setting, I would simply quit. Thank you <3

Now with that rant out of the way, lets get to the real thing. The purpose of starting this devblog is, as stated in the home page to document my coding journey, which I wish to turn into a regular habit. I am a Google Summer of Code aspirant, probably one of the few non-STEM background ones too, which entails that I have to go a little bit above and beyond for both the purposes of my own learning as well as being a decent applicant. If I am following the memes, my competition is probably going to be people who can rewrite the intel architecture microcode.

This devblog utilises [Astro](https://astro.build/), a very wonderful framework which has some really good pre-made templates especially for SSG blogs, cutting down a lot of the frontend work required which can be seen in other SSR generators such as Hugo, jekyll and others. However the best part about astro lies in the fact that its a javascript framework which means it has all the extensibility in the world that other technologies such as vue, react, threejs and others can bring, hell I even plan to add a threejs integration to the home page down the line. 

I have been meaning to sit down and build a proper devblog for a good while, to document and share my coding journey and learnings to 
potential readers and recruiters but have been stuck along the way trying out so many different things and then abandoning it because it becomes too demanding to write or debug, which brings to me a to a central problem I wish to talk about that other developers, especially those starting out, including me have faced along the way.

#### The shiny object syndrome

There is probably 4 other folders called "blog" in my Development folder that are all projects I stopped working on because I would not get the result I would not want. I was an unknowing victim of the so called [Shiny Object Syndrome](https://coffeebytes.dev/en/be-careful-of-shiny-object-syndrome-and-fomo-in-web-development/), the coffeebytes article I have hyperlinked gives a much more detailed overview of the social phenomenon but here is a basic gist from my experience perspective

<i>I start new project with an exciting new web technology > spend a few days or weeks in the project > leave it unfinished because I either lack the motivation to continue, has become too hard to mantain or I have already started planning to use a new technology that meets my needs > burnout > sit down with a fresh project with some new technology > cycle repeats </i>

I have been continuing this cycle for years now, so even if I have been programming since 2020s, I lack tangible projects/contributions on my end which has come to bite me in the back now with my elevated aspirations. I wish to change this and the change has already begun, but let me talk about some specific habits that activated this syndrome
* simply just jumping into using a specific technology for a project because the landing page and documentation looked cool.
* not doing proper prior research into the technology and its features and limitations before using it, leading to non-codebase related problems such as outdated versions, platform not being supported etc.
* being reliant on AI driven development rather than taking the time to solve problems myself, which means if the AI is not giving me a directly good solution to my problem I just call quits. 
* watching clickbaity youtube videos that advocate for a particular web technology.
* burning myself out by working on the same project for hours.
* working on a completely new idea after the burnout phase ends.

These are the nasty habits which are attributed to the Shiny Object Syndrome, and has caused me major setbacks in my programming "CaReER". This blog is one of the projects that I will indefinitely continue and contribute to always as one of my first steps out of the Shiny Object Syndrome. I have currently three active projects that I am alternating between which are enjoyable and important to me. I will cover more of each in my future blogs

<b>How I got out of the Shiny Object Syndrome</b>

My first exposure to astro was through this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/3_JE76PKBWE?si=4VmjOiMHcUytyB6U), I highly recommend this channel its amazing and soothing. I researched all the potential uses and examples of astro and determined it was the best fit for my purposes of developing a simple devblog with available options of extending the frontend using technologies like threejs (just because its cool). I did my proper research into the technology I was using and ascertained that I will stick to it as a means of building proficiency in the same. I still actively use AI driven development using tools such as the Cursor IDE but I use it less as a replacement of my own thinking but an assistant whose work I proofread constantly so I understand it myself and solve problems that it fails to solve. I also actively avoid contemplating using some new technology because fireship posted a new video covering it. I have also routinised my programming sessions to be 1-2 hours long with breaks in between, These steps have helped me grow out of the Shiny Object Syndrome a lot.

<B>Thanking myself (no narcissism intended)</B>

I thank my decision to aspire to apply for Google Summer of Code because it began a very important self betterment routine regarding one of my prime hobbies that I would have probably not fixed otherwise. I see a lot of people shocked around me when I tell them that I as an English Major have a coding background. It is also a regular stigma around the industry that only STEM background people can be successful in this industry. I am not any senior developer to give a definitive opinion, but being a part of several huge developer communities and interacting with people with similar backgrounds to me, I can definitely opiniate that learning programming and making it in the field is all about your interest, developing routines, discipline, constantly learning and being creative with what you have, and these are all assymetric to whatever background you come from. I am willing to break barriers I do not care about simply because I love the art that is coding.
